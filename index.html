          <h4 class="item-title">School motto</h4>
        <p>The motto of Columbia University is "In thy light shall we see light." It can be translated into Chinese as "By your light, we can see the light" or "In the spirit of God we seek knowledge", which is based on the "Old Testament Psalms": "Quoniam apud te fons vitae in lumine tuo videbimus lumen" (Latin). The English translation is: "For with there is the fountain of life; and in the light we shall see light."The school motto has a strong religious flavor, but it does not hinder people's determination and courage to pursue truth and find light. </p>
