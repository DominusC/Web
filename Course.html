          <h4 class="item-title">Computational Science and Engineering </h4>
        <p>
CSE is an exciting and rapidly evolving field that exploits the power of computation as an approach to major challenges at the frontiers of natural and social science and all engineering fields. Sitting at the intersection of Computer Science and Applied Math, the program offers students experience with mathematical techniques for modeling and simulation of complex systems; parallel programming and collaborative software development; and methods for organizing, exploring, visualizing, processing and analyzing very large data sets.</p>

          <h4 class="item-title">Artificial Intelligence</h4>
        <p>Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that attempts to understand the essence of intelligence and produce a new kind of intelligent machine that can respond in a similar way to human intelligence. Research in this field includes robotics, language recognition, image recognition, Natural language processing and expert systems, etc. Since the birth of artificial intelligence, the theory and technology have become more and more mature, and the application field has also continued to expand. It is conceivable that the technological products brought by artificial intelligence in the future will be the "container" of human intelligence. Artificial intelligence can simulate the information process of human consciousness and thinking. Artificial intelligence is not human intelligence, but it can think like human beings and may surpass human intelligence. </p>

          <h4 class="item-title">Computer Vision</h4>
         
        <p>Computer vision is the study of how to use cameras and computers to obtain the data and information we need about the subject being photographed. To put it figuratively, it is to install eyes (cameras) and brains (algorithms) on the computer, so that the computer can perceive the environment. Computer vision is a challenging and important research area in both engineering and science. Computer vision is a comprehensive discipline, and it has attracted researchers from various disciplines to participate in its research. These include computer science and engineering, signal processing, physics, applied mathematics and statistics, neurophysiology and cognitive science, among others.</p>

          <h4 class="item-title">Management Information Systems</h4>
        <p>MIS (Management Information Systems) is mainly people-oriented, and aims to use modern computer and network communication technology to strengthen the information management of enterprises. Through this system, enterprises can process the human, material, financial and other resources of the enterprise, compile various effective data and establish a correct database, and provide it to the enterprise management department, so as to facilitate them according to the information and materials they have mastered. Make the right decisions and manage the enterprise.</p>
